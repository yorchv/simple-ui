# simple-ui
A simple Design System builder

Main Goal:
- That I don't do any other new design system ever again from scratch.
- People don't code over and over again the same thing.

Constrains:
- Ultra simple: Start with the top 10 components required to build a page
- Ultra fast: People can get a new design system in minutes
- Ultra Customizable: Allow the usage of Tailwind to build Themes

Outcome:
- Exportable react components.
- Exportable Tailwind Config.
- Exportable TS types.
- The main output will be a JSON file that describes their design system and that can be used for version control.
